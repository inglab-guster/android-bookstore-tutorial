# The Odd Bookstore
This project is an Android skeleton to build a simple bookstore with some weird functionality.
Your task is to complete the application with the requirements specified below.

## Task 1 - UI imlementation
Create Activity classes accordingly based on the screen designs provided below:
- [Splash](docs/files/splash.md)
- [Login](docs/files/login.md)

- Use standard HTTP status code to determine if a response is successful, eg ``200`` is successful
- Base URL: ``http://198.211.112.145:8001``
- Example request call: ``http://198.211.112.145:8001/api/books``

## Task 3 - Implement weird features

### 1. Location change detection
The app must be able to detect the device's GPS location change.
When location changes, get the current location coordinates (lat, long) and show in a toast.

### 2. Heartbeat in foreground
When the app is in the foreground, do the following:
- Start a Timer or Scheduler and use it to send the current location coordinates to the server every 10 seconds.
- Stop any background service (Refer to the task below)

### 3. Heartbeat in background
When app is in background, do the following:
- Start an Android Service to send current location coordinates to the server every 10 seconds.
- Stop any Timer or Scheduler that was previously created (Refer to the task above).
